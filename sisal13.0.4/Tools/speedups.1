.TH SPEEDUPS local
.SH NAME
speedups \- SISAL parallel speedups data gatherer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B speedups
strtnr endnr abs [ options ] [ infile ] [ outfile ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Speedups
repeatedly executes the compiled SISAL program ``abs'' using
different numbers of processors, beginning with ``startnr'' and
\fIincrementing\fR through ``endnr.''  For each execution it
automatically appends the ``-\fBw\fRNUM'' option (overriding any of your own).
It also enables ``-\fBr\fR'' so that each execution produces file s.info.
When speedups completes,
file ``$abs:t.info.$strtnr-$endnr'' will contain the concatenation of all
the performance data.

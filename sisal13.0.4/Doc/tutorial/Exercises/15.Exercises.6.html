<H4>Exercise 6.1: Quadratic Roots Function</H4>
Given:  three real values, <TT>a</TT>, <TT>b</TT>, and <TT>c</TT>, and the formula for the roots of a quadratic equation<BR>
<TT>x1 = b + (b**2-4ac)**0.5/2a</TT> and<BR>
<TT>x2 = b - (b**2-4ac)**0.5/2a</TT>;<BR>
Compose: a function of <TT>a</TT>, <TT>b</TT>, and <TT>c</TT> that calculates and returns the roots or some flag values if the roots cannot be calculated.<BR>

<H4>Exercise 6.2: Relaxation Function</H4>
Given:  a two-dimensional array, <TT>A</TT>, of real values<BR>
Compose: a function of <TT>A</TT> that performs one relaxation step, returning the new array whose values at each position [i, j]  are the average of the values from <TT>A</TT> of that position and that position's eight nearest neighbors, [i+/-1, j+/-1].<BR>

<H4>Exercise 6.3: Polynomial  Evaluation Program</H4>
Given:  a two-dimensional array, <TT>C</TT>, of real valued polynomial coefficients, each row of which contains the coefficients of a single polynomial;<BR>
Given: for each row of <TT>C</TT>, the index of each coefficient's position is the exponent of x for that term;<BR>
Given: a one-dimensional array <TT>X</TT> of real valued polynomial unknowns, with each element corresponding to the unknown for the whole set of polynomials;<BR>
Compose: a function of <TT>C</TT> and <TT>X</TT> that evaluates each polynomial with each unknown, and returns the two-dimensional array containing in each row the value of each polynomial for one of the unknowns.<BR>

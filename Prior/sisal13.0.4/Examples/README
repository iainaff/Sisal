This directory contains examples of Sisal programs, sometimes
accompanied by their Fortran equivalent.

fft: Fast fourier transform developed by John Feo -- outperforms
Cray's system routine!

loops: Livermore loops in Sisal.

misc: Miscellaneous examples -- a good place to start to get a
feel for Sisal programming techniques.

weather: An atmospheric circulation model in Sisal and Fortran.
The Fortran version is from the Meteorology Department of the
University of Melbourne and the Sisal translation was done at
the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.

All of these programs were snarfed from the Sisal anonymous ftp
site at LLNL.

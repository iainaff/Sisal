<H2>16. Sequential Looping with For-Initial Loops</H2>

In this section we will discuss the sequential or iterative looping construct 
in Sisal. Unlike the for-loop, in which all instances of the loop body are 
independent, the Sisal "for-initial" loop involves the explicit passing of 
information between consecutive instances of the loop body. This is 
visualized as a graph with a sequence of nodes, representing loop bodies, and 
the arcs between them representing the data dependencies between the loop 
bodies. The bodies (nodes) bear what we term a "producer-consumer" 
relationship to one another, and this establishes their interdependency. 
Syntactically, the data calculated in one body that is to be made available 
to the next body is identified in the consuming body by use of the keyword 
"old" before the identifier name. But it will be much easier to explain by 
example, so consider the following:<P>

<H3>16.1 Two-Body Loops</H3>

The for-initial loop consists of two major parts, the initial-clause and the 
loop body proper. One way to think of this type of loop is to consider that 
the initial clause is the first "iteration", or the first actual loop body 
that gets executed; after it executes exactly once, zero or more instances of 
the loop body proper execute. The need for a distinguished first "iteration" 
is easy to explain by example, and we will look at one directly. However, for 
the moment, keep in mind that the loop must always return a specified number 
of results of specified types. These results are initially generated in the 
initial-clause, and then may get further treatment in the loop body proper, 
if it executes. With this in mind, consider the following example:<P>

<PRE>for initial
   i := array_liml(A);
   tmp := A[i];
   running_sum := tmp
while i < array_limh(A) repeat
   i := old i + 1;
   tmp := A[i];
   running_sum := old running_sum + tmp
returns value of running_sum
        array of running_sum
end for</PRE>

In this example we first see the loop keywords  "<TT>for initial</TT>" which 
identify it as a sequential loop, and which open what we call the "initial 
clause" of the loop. This clause contains the initial definitions of the 
loop-carried values, "<TT>i</TT>", and "<TT>running_sum</TT>", which 
implement the data dependencies between the contiguous body instances.<P>

Like the body of a for-loop, the initial clause of a for-initial loop can 
also contain the definitions of loop-local names, which are temporary 
identifiers used subsequently in the calculation but not passed between loop 
bodies; this is the purpose of "<TT>tmp</TT>". Next, we see the iteration 
termination test. This is a predicate, evaluating to a Boolean value, which 
uses either the "<TT>while</TT>" or "<TT>until</TT>" keyword to specify how 
the test is to be applied. The termination test can be at either the top or 
the bottom of the loop body; in this case it is at the top, and we refer to
this form of loop as "top-tested."  If it were at the bottom of the loop
body, we would call it a "bottom-tested loop", and the keyword
"<TT>repeat</TT>" would still be used to demarcate the top of the loop body.<P>

The body of this loop shows the use of the keyword "<TT>old</TT>" to specify 
data passed in from previous bodies. In fact, it is more technically correct 
to call them "scopes" than "bodies", but the effect is the same. The 
statement  "<TT>i := old i + 1</TT>" specifies that the value named 
"<TT>i</TT>" from the previous scope (i.e. "<TT>old i</TT>") is to be 
incremented by one and assigned the name "<TT>i</TT>" in this scope. While 
this may look like a violation of the single-assignment rule, it actually is 
not; the values named "<TT>i</TT>" and "<TT>old i</TT>" are two different 
entities, having independent existences, except for the value of the former 
being determined by the latter. The same thing holds for 
"<TT>running_sum</TT>", and we refer collectively to all of the instances of 
"<TT>i</TT>", "<TT>old i</TT>", "<TT>running_sum</TT>", and "<TT>old 
running_sum</TT>" as the  "loop-carried values  '<TT>i</TT>' and 
'<TT>running_sum</TT>'", respectively.<P>

So, the way the values are passed between the loop bodies is like this. The
first time the statement "<TT>i := old i + 1</TT>" in loop body is executed,
the meaning of "<TT>old i</TT>" is that value of "<TT>i</TT>" defined in the
initial clause of the loop. Subsequent to this, it means that value of
"<TT>i</TT>" defined in the most recent body before the current one. The
ordering of the loop bodies' execution is totally determined by the effects
of the termination test and the loop-carried values. Notice that the
identifier "<TT>tmp</TT>" does not appear with the modifier keyword
"<TT>old</TT>"; this is because its value is not passed between loop bodies,
but is calculated anew in each body. This "loop-local" identifier is similar
to those temporaries that are defined in the bodies of parallel for-loops,
in that each instance of  it is independent of all the others, and we simply
allow the reuse of its name for the convenience of the programmer.<P>

At the end of the body we see the returns clause, just like that of the for-
loop. It can contain the same aggregation and reduction operations, which can 
operate on any or all of the loop-carried values; they can also contain the 
same Boolean masks, using the keywords "<TT>when</TT>" or "<TT>unless</TT>", 
to allow operation on subsets of the instances of any or all of the loop-
carried values. The loop above returns both a value and an array; it adds up 
all the elements of the array "<TT>A</TT>", aggregates all the running 
subtotals into an array, and returns the total and the array of subtotals.<P>

<H3>16.2 One-Body Loops</H3>

Now we need to return to the philosophy of sequential loops, to make sure all 
their ramifications are well explained. The for-initial loop is an 
expression, and all expressions have values. A given loop must return the 
same number and types of results, regardless of how many or few times it 
"iterates". If the body of the loop above never executes, because the array 
"<TT>A</TT>" is empty and the termination criterion is met the first time it 
is encountered, then the loop will still try to return the same two values. 
If we are sure that the array "<TT>A</TT>" contains at least one value, then 
the loop as written above will behave correctly, and there will be an initial 
i-th element to be assigned to the name "<TT>tmp</TT>"; otherwise, that array 
reference in the initial-clause will fail with an address-out-of-range 
runtime error. This situation must be planned for carefully! In the case 
above, the initial clause is actually the first real instance of the body of 
the loop. In other circumstances, we might want to program the loop so that 
the initial-clause sets up the values to be returned in the case where the 
body is not executable. In such situations, we are actually providing, in the 
initial-clause, default values to be returned if the body does not execute, 
and these default values can be considered the identity elements for the 
operations in the returns clause. In this a case, the loop might change to 
that shown below:<P>

<PRE>for initial
   i := array_liml(A) - 1;
   tmp := 0;
   running_sum := tmp
while i < array_limh(A) & array_size(A) ~= 0 repeat
   i := old i + 1;
   tmp := A[i];
   running_sum := old running_sum + tmp
returns value of running_sum
        array of running_sum
end for</PRE>

In the above version of the loop, we use the initial-clause to set up for the 
actual loop body, defining the first value of the loop index, "<TT>i</TT>" as 
one less than the lower bound of the array, and the value of 
"<TT>running_sum</TT>" as zero. Then, the loop body uses a value for 
"<TT>i</TT>" that is legal within the array, if the termination test allows 
the body to execute. The returns clause in this version will return zero and 
an array containing the single element zero, if the loop body does not 
execute. The previous version would have failed with a run-time error, if 
this had occurred. We also see, in the second version, that the termination 
test is altered, to allow for the array "<TT>A</TT>" to be empty and to have 
a lower bound that is greater than its upper bound by more than one. Recall 
that an empty array can have any bounds as long as the lower bound is greater 
than its upper bound; it is possible that an algorithmically-generated array 
might have bounds of, say [-5, 0 ], due to unexpected behavior of the code 
the generates it. The addition of the array-size primitive protects the loop 
against this possibility.<P>

<H3>16.3 Sequential Array Manipulation</H3>

But suppose we did not want to return an array containing the single element 
"0", as shown above, in the case of the body not executing; a more reasonable 
thing to return in this case might be an empty array. This can be done if we 
can define an empty array and then go on to fill it one or more elements at a 
time. This is possible in Sisal, and the code below shows another version of 
the loop that accomplishes it:<P>

<PRE>for initial
   i := array_liml(A) - 1;
   tmp := 0;
   running_sum := tmp;
   running_sum_array := array []
while i < array_limh(A) & array_size(A) ~= 0 repeat
   i := old i + 1;
   tmp := A[i];
   running_sum := old running_sum + tmp;
   running_sum_array := array_addh(old running_sum_array, running_sum)
returns value of running_sum
        value of running_sum_array
end for</PRE>

Here we have added another loop-carried value, "<TT>running_sum_array</TT>", 
which is initialized to an empty array in the initial clause and returned in 
the returns clause. In the body, we see it is operated on by the Sisal 
primitive "<TT>array_addh</TT>"; this primitive extends the array given as 
its first argument, at the upper end of its index range, by one element whose 
value is the second argument. This affects both the contents of the array and 
its index bounds, and is a very handy primitive to have in such a case as 
this. Note that in the returns clause, the second value being returned is now 
generated by a "value-of" operation, rather than by an operation. Since the 
array we wish to return was created in the initial-clause and is being 
incrementally filled by the loop body, we simply return the "last" version of 
it generated by the loop as a whole. While the incremental expansion of this 
array as the loopexecutes would normally be a source of inefficiency, the 
Optimzing Sisal Compiler is able to optimize such programs so that the 
structure is built in place quite efficiently.<P>

As one might expect by now, there is also a primitive to extend an array at 
the bottom end of its index range, as well as primitives to change one or 
more elements of an array, to shrink arrays at either end, and primitives to 
adjust the index range of arrays. These are specified in the following table, 
along with all the other array operations we have already seen; in the table, 
"<TT>A</TT>" is an array, "<TT>v</TT>" is a value of the proper type for 
elements of "<TT>A</TT>", and "<TT>low</TT>" and "<TT>high</TT>" are 
integers:<P>

<PRE>array primitive           effect
========================================================
array_size(A)            get number of elements
array_limh(A)            get upper bound
array_liml(A)            get lower bound
array_addh(A,v)          extend at high end
array_addl(A,v)          extend at low end
array_remh(A)            remove at high end
array_reml(A)            remove at low end
array_adjust(A,low,high) set both bounds
array_setl(A,low)        set lower bound
A[ i : v ]               change value at index i to v
A[ i: u, v, w ]          change values at indices 
                            i, i+1, and i+2 to 
                            u, v, and w, respectively
A[ i: u; j: v ]          change values at indices i and j
                            to u and v, respectively</PRE>

The above primitives allow us to operate on arrays in useful ways, and are 
most often used in sequential loops, such as we have been discussing. 
However, they can also occur in other code, such as let-in statements, and it 
bears emphasizing that the arrays they produce are different values from 
those they operate on. In other words, we could have the following code:<P>

<PRE>let A := array [ 1: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25];
    B := array_addl(A, -5);
    C := array_addh(A, 30);
    D := array_reml(A);
    E := array_adjust(A, 3, 4);
    F := A[ 1: -5; 3: -15, -20 ]
in  A, B, C, D, E, F
end let</PRE>

The above let-in statement returns the following values:<P>

<PRE>array [ 1: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]       % The array A
array [ 0: -5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 ]  % B = A with new first element and 
                                    %     lower bound
array [ 1: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 ]  % C = A with new last element and 
                                    %     upper bound
array [ 2: 10, 15, 20, 25 ]         % D = A minus first element, with new 
                                    %     lower bound
array [ 3: 15, 20 ]                 % E = A minus several elements, with 
                                    %     new bounds
array [ 1: -5, 10, -15, -20, 25 ]   % F = A with several elements changed
</PRE>

Note that none of the operations on "<TT>A</TT>" changes its value; Rather, 
they produce new values of array types whose elements and index ranges are 
related to those of their argument array.<P>

<H3>16.4 Termination Tests and the Generation of the "old" Value</H3>

The need to pass values between consecutive instances of a loop body, and in 
so doing, define an identifier "old {name}" and simultaneously undefine an
identifier {name} requires some careful timing. In the case of a top-tested loop,
it is not possible to reference both {name} and "old {name}" in the termination
test, because the the first time the test is evaluated, only one of these values
is defined. The redefinition of names of loop-carried values takes place 
immediately after the termination test. In the case of the loop shown 
schematically below,<P>

<PRE>        for initial
           val := initial_value
        while {test(val)} repeat
           val := f(old val)
        returns val
        end for</PRE> 

the value associated with the name "<TT>val</TT>" changes its name to
"<TT>old val</TT>" right after "<TT>test(val)</TT>" is executed, and the
named "<TT>val</TT>" becomes undefined at the same time. Note that the
test can contain references to "<TT>val</TT>" but not "<TT>old val</TT>",
since the latter is not defined the first time the test is encountered.
This form of loop is called a "top-tested loop."<P>

If a test which refers to both names is desired, it must be placed at the
bottom of the loop body, as in the following example:<P>

<PRE>        for initial
           val := initial_value
        repeat
           val := f(old val)
        while {test(val, old val)} 
        returns val
        end for</PRE> 

The first time "<TT>test(val, old val)</TT>" is executed, both names are
defined, since the former was just calculated and the latter was calculated
in the initial clause. Immediately after the test, the value named
"<TT>val</TT>" changes its name to "<TT>old val</TT>" and the value
"<TT>val</TT>" becomes undefined at the same time. This form of loop is
called a "bottom-tested loop."<P>

Next are a few exercises intended to cement the concepts discussed above.<P>

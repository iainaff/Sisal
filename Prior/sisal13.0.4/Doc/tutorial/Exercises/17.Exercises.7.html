<H2>17. Exercise Set 7</H2>
<H4>Exercise 7.1: Newton Square Root Loop</H4>
Given:  a real value <TT>Y</TT>, and the formula for Newton's square root algorithm,<BR>
x(i) = (Y/x(i-1) + x(i-1))/2, where x(0)=Y/2;<BR>
Given: termination criterion: |Y - x(i)**2| < epsilon, a real value;<BR>
Compose: a for-initial loop that calculates successive approximations x(i) until the termination criterion is met, and returns the final value of the approximation as well as the number of approximations, x(i), i >0, that have been calculated.<BR>

<H4>Exercise 7.2: First Maximum and Minimum Loop</H4>
Given:	a one-dimensional array, <TT>A</TT>, of real values;<BR>
Compose: a for-initial loop that finds the first instance of the minimum and maximum values present in the array, and returns these values and their index positions.<BR>

<H4>Exercise 7.3: Successive Relaxation Loop</H4>
Given:  a two-dimensional array, <TT>A</TT>, of real values;<BR>
Given:  a predefined termination test function <TT>converged(x,y,eps)</TT> ,which takes two conformable two_dimensional arrays, <TT>x</TT>, and <TT>y</TT>, and a real value <TT>eps</TT>, and  returns a Boolean value if its metric is met with respect to its third argument;<BR>
Compose: a function containing a for_initial loop that uses the function from exercise 16 to successively relax <TT>A</TT> until convergence occurs, and returns the converged value of A and the number of relaxations that have occurred.<BR>
Hint: Since the convergence function requires two arrays, one could use a bottom-tested loop...<BR>

<H4>Exercise 7.4: Conway's Game of Life</H4>
Given:  a two-dimensional array, <TT>Board</TT>, of integer cell values, zero for a dead cell and positive nonzero for a live one;<BR>
Given:  the boundaries cells around the edge of <TT>Board</TT> are always dead;<BR>
Given:  the rules by which a non-boundary cell lives or dies:
<PRE>     if three or fewer neighbor cells are alive, then cell dies;
     if five or more neighbors cells are alive then cell dies;
     if four neighbor cells are alive, then increment current cell value;</PRE>
Compose:  a program that plays evolves the <TT>Board</TT> array until some input number of steps are completed, and returns an array of all the values taken on by <TT>Board</TT>.<BR>

<H4>6.1.4 Record Creation</H4>
To illustrate record creation, we will use the example declarations we used earlier:
<PRE>type element_record = record [ name : array [ character ];
                               number : integer;
                               weight : real ]
type atomic_table = array [ element_record ];
</PRE>
When creating items of record types, we specify the matched pairs of field names and contents, in the order given in the type definition. Here are examples:
<PRE>let hydrogen := record element_record [ name: "Hydrogen"; number: 1;
                                            weight: 1.0 ];
    helium   := record element_record [ name: "Helium"; number: 2; 
                                        weight: 4.0 ];
    element_115 := record element_record [ name: ""; number: 115;
                                           weight: -999.999];
    column1 := array atomic_table [ 1: hydrogen, helium, element_115 ]

in hydrogen, helium, element_115, column1
end let</PRE>

Here we see three records being created, each of which has its type, <TT>element_record</TT>,  specified along with it. This is sometimes optional, but it's a good practice to adopt, nonetheless, as it helps clarify the code to human readers. The first two records, <TT>hydrogen</TT> and <TT>helium</TT> have their field names and values specified in the order given in the original declaration, and with reasonable values. The field names must be paired with the field values, with a colon separating each name and value, and a semicolon separating the pairs, as in the definition of the type. In the third record, <TT>element_115</TT>, we see and empty string used for the name and a negative value for the weight, used as flag values. This is still a legal record, since all the fields are specified in order and with correct types.<P>

The fourth item created and returned above is an array named <TT>column1</TT> of type <TT>atomic_table</TT>. We will see more about creating arrays in the next section.<P>

<H4>Exercise 6.2: Relaxation Function</H4>
Given:  a two-dimensional array, <TT>A</TT>, of real values<BR>
Compose: a function of <TT>A</TT> that performs one relaxation step, returning the new array whose values at each position [i, j]  are the average of the values from <TT>A</TT> of that position and that position's eight nearest neighbors, [i+/-1, j+/-1].<BR>
Note: Keep the edges of the input system constant, relax only the elements of the system having eight neighbors, and return only the relaxed subsystem.
the portion that has been relaxed.<BR>
<PRE>type OneDim = array [ real ];
type TwoDim = array [ OneDim ];
 
function main( A : TwoDim returns TwoDim )
 
for i in array_liml(A)   +1, array_limh(A)   -1 cross
    j in array_liml(A[i])+1, array_limh(A[i])-1
   avg := (A[i,j]      + A[i, j-1] + A[i, j+1] +
           A[i+1, j-1] + A[i+1, j] + A[i+1, j+1] +
           A[i-1, j-1] + A[i-1, j] + A[i-1, j+1]) / 9.0
returns array of avg
end for
 
end function

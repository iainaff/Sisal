<H4>Exercise 2.2:  More Statistics</H4>
<PRE>Given: four three-element arrays, a, b, c, and d, all containing real numbers;
       the formulas for the mean and standard deviation
            mean = (a+b+c+d)/4;
            standard deviation = (((a-mean)**2 + (b-mean)**2 +
                                   (c-mean)**2 + (d-mean)**2) / 3)**0.5</PRE>
Compose: a let-in statement that returns an array of records, each containing the mean and standard deviation of one of the given sets of numbers.<BR>
<PRE>let mean_a := (a[1] + a[2] + a[3])/3.0;

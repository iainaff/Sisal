* Release 14.1.0:

** Fixed name conflicts with GNU C Library

** Fixed bug 2805801: Tests/fromC.sis can't be compiled with gcc4

** Fixed buffer overrun in "stryng" library functions (frontend)

** Automake-compliant build scripts

   Known issues:

   1) "make install" should be run explicitly;

   2) since SISAL compiler can't be run directly from the build directory,
      "make check" should be run only after "make install";

   3) "make distcheck" is not working properly at all for the same reason;

   4) "make dist" skips files not involved in building (experimental, etc.).

** User-defined output file name in '-c' mode

** Improved efficiency of runtime checks with 'noreturn' attribute

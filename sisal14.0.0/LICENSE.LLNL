Dave,

I now have the final approved version of the notices.  The key sentence for
you is the first one under Limitations on Use.  I am also sending this info
to Pat Miller in hopes that he can take the final steps to make the changes
to our source distributions and let everyone know they need to get the
latest version of this material.  OK Pat?

As an interesting aside, I was surprised at the weak wording of the last
sentence which only requires "notifying" us before commercializing the
product.  I checked, and indeed we mean what we are saying, in that someone
could commercialize this without needing some form of license.  So this is
about as broad a scope of use statement as the government will permit.

Jim
